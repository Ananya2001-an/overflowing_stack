## Overflowing Stack

This is a **MERN stack** project. I have tried creating a simple clone of stack overflow. After deciding with the design of my database, I started developing the backend with node first. Later, I connected the server to my local MongoDB and started working on the frontend with Vite React template.

I have also tried using **azure functions** for the first time to understand serverless computing. I have created a simple function that creates a new user in the database. For this I have connected my function to MongoDB Atlas. You can read more about it [here](azure_functions_serverless.md).

### Tech Stack
- React
- Node.js
